    explanation: `ChatGPT is an AI assistant created by OpenAI that can have conversations with you, answer questions, help with homework, write stories, and much more.

Think of it like a very knowledgeable friend who has read millions of books, articles, and websites. When you ask it something, it uses all that knowledge to give you helpful responses.

**Important to know:**
• ChatGPT was trained on text data up to a certain date, so it doesn't know about very recent events
• It can make mistakes (called "hallucinations") so always verify important facts
• It's a tool to help you learn, not to do your thinking for you`,
    example: `**You ask:** "Can you explain the water cycle for my geography project?"

**ChatGPT responds:** "The water cycle has four main stages:

1. **Evaporation** - The sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into water vapor that rises into the air.

2. **Condensation** - As water vapor rises and cools, it forms tiny droplets that create clouds.

3. **Precipitation** - When clouds become heavy with water droplets, they fall as rain, snow, or hail.

4. **Collection** - Water collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans, and the cycle starts again!

Fun fact: The water you drink today might have been drunk by a dinosaur millions of years ago!"`,

    title: 'LLM Model Basics',
    minutes: 15,
    level: 'beginner',
    explanation: `LLM stands for "Large Language Model" - it's the technology that powers ChatGPT.

**How does an LLM work?**
Imagine teaching a child to predict the next word in a sentence by reading thousands of books. That's similar to how LLMs learn!

1. **Training:** The AI reads billions of sentences from books, websites, and articles
2. **Pattern Learning:** It learns how words and ideas connect together
3. **Prediction:** When you ask something, it predicts what words should come next based on patterns

**Key Concepts:**

• **Neural Network:** The "brain" of the AI - layers of math that process information
• **Parameters:** Adjustable values (like knobs) that were tuned during training. GPT-4 has over 100 billion parameters!
• **Training Data:** All the text the AI learned from

**Important:** LLMs don't "understand" like humans. They're incredibly good at recognizing and reproducing patterns in language.`,
    example: `**Think of it like autocomplete on steroids:**

When you type "Good morning, how are..." on your phone, it might suggest "you" as the next word.

LLMs do the same thing, but for entire paragraphs! They consider:
- What you just asked
- The context of the conversation
- Patterns from all the text they've learned

**Real example:**
Prompt: "Write a haiku about monsoon in Mumbai"
The LLM predicts word by word:
"Grey → clouds → gather → fast → / → Raindrops → dance → on → hot → streets → / → Relief → at → last"

It's not thinking creatively - it's predicting what words typically follow each other in haiku poems about rain!`,

    id: 'chatgpt-context-tokens',
    title: 'Context Window & Tokens',
    minutes: 12,
    level: 'beginner',
    explanation: `When you chat with ChatGPT, it breaks your text into small pieces called "tokens" and can only remember a certain amount at a time (the "context window").

**What are Tokens?**
Tokens are chunks of text - usually words or parts of words.

Examples:
• "Hello" = 1 token
• "Cricket" = 1 token  
• "Unbelievable" = 3 tokens ("Un" + "believ" + "able")
• "ChatGPT is amazing!" = 5 tokens

**What is the Context Window?**
Think of it as ChatGPT's "working memory" - how much of the conversation it can hold at once.

• GPT-3.5: ~4,000 tokens (about 3,000 words)
• GPT-4: ~8,000-128,000 tokens depending on version

**Why does this matter?**
1. Very long conversations get "forgotten" - ChatGPT loses track of what you discussed earlier
2. Longer prompts use more tokens, leaving less space for the response
3. You pay for tokens when using the API (not the free version)

**Pro tip:** If ChatGPT seems to forget something, it might have exceeded its context window!`,
    example: `**Imagine ChatGPT's memory as a whiteboard:**

You start a conversation about your science project on plants. You discuss:
1. Types of plants (fills 1/4 of whiteboard)
2. Photosynthesis (fills another 1/4)
3. Your experiment design (fills another 1/4)
4. Results you expect (fills the last 1/4)

Now if you ask about fertilizers, ChatGPT needs to write new information. It erases the oldest stuff (types of plants) to make room!

**That's why:**
- ChatGPT might "forget" things you mentioned at the start
- Important info should be repeated or placed near the end
- Starting a new chat resets the context`,

    title: 'Prompt Patterns & Techniques',
    minutes: 15,
    level: 'intermediate',
    explanation: `A "prompt" is the message you send to ChatGPT. Better prompts = better answers! Here are proven patterns that work:

**The RACE Framework:**
• **R**ole: Tell ChatGPT who to be ("You are a friendly science teacher")
• **A**ction: What you want it to do ("Explain photosynthesis")
• **C**ontext: Background info ("For a Class 8 student in India")
• **E**xpectation: How you want the output ("In simple bullet points, under 100 words")

**Powerful Prompt Patterns:**

1. **Persona Pattern**
   "You are a cricket commentator. Describe how a computer processes data like it's a cricket match."

2. **Few-Shot Pattern** (give examples)
   "Convert to formal: 'gonna go home' → 'I am going to go home'
   Now convert: 'wanna grab lunch'"

3. **Chain of Thought**
   "Solve this step by step: If a train travels 60 km in 45 minutes..."

4. **Critique Pattern**
   "Here's my essay introduction. What are 3 ways to improve it?"

5. **Template Pattern**
   "Fill in this template for my book report: Title: ___, Author: ___, Main theme: ___"`,
    example: `**Bad prompt:**
"Tell me about history"

**Good prompt using RACE:**
"**Role:** You are a fun history teacher who uses Bollywood movie references.
**Action:** Explain the Indian independence movement.
**Context:** I'm a Class 10 student preparing for my board exams.
**Expectation:** Give me 5 key events with dates, and compare each to a movie scene I might know."

**The difference:**
- Bad prompt → Vague, generic response about any history topic
- Good prompt → Specific, engaging, exam-relevant information tailored to you!`,

    title: 'AI Hallucinations & Fact-Checking',
    minutes: 12,
    level: 'intermediate',
    explanation: `Sometimes ChatGPT confidently states things that are completely wrong. This is called "hallucination" - and it's one of the most important things to understand about AI.

**Why do hallucinations happen?**
• ChatGPT predicts likely words, not facts
• It fills gaps with plausible-sounding information
• It can't say "I don't know" easily - it always generates something
• Training data may have had errors

**Common hallucination types:**
1. **Fake citations:** Invents book titles, research papers, quotes
2. **Wrong facts:** Incorrect dates, statistics, names
3. **Confident nonsense:** Made-up technical explanations
4. **Outdated info:** Treats old information as current

**Red flags to watch for:**
• Very specific statistics or percentages
• Quotes attributed to famous people
• Recent events (after training cutoff)
• Detailed claims about niche topics
• Links or references (ChatGPT can't browse the web)

**The Golden Rule:** Always verify important information from reliable sources!`,
    example: `**Real hallucination example:**

**Prompt:** "Tell me about the famous Indian scientist Dr. Rajesh Kumar who invented the solar calculator."

**ChatGPT might respond:** "Dr. Rajesh Kumar (1945-2012) was a pioneering Indian physicist from IIT Bombay who invented the solar-powered calculator in 1978. His work earned him the Padma Shri in 1985..."

**The problem:** This person and invention are completely made up! ChatGPT generated a believable-sounding response because:
- The name sounds realistic
- The dates seem plausible
- The institutions are real
- The award exists

**This is why fact-checking matters!**`,

    title: 'Responsible AI Use',
    minutes: 12,
    level: 'intermediate',
    explanation: `Using AI responsibly is like being a good digital citizen. Here's your guide to ethical AI use:

**DO ✅**
• Use AI as a learning helper and thinking partner
• Write assignments in your own words after understanding concepts
• Give credit when AI helped you ("I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas")
• Verify facts before using them
• Report inappropriate AI responses
• Ask for explanations, not just answers

**DON'T ❌**
• Copy AI responses as your own work (that's plagiarism)
• Share personal information (address, phone, school name, photos)
• Use AI to create harmful, fake, or misleading content
• Trust everything without checking
• Use AI to do work you should learn yourself
• Try to "jailbreak" AI to bypass safety features

**Why This Matters:**
• Academic integrity: Your school has rules about AI use
• Personal safety: Protect your private information
• Learning: You miss learning opportunities if AI does everything
• Ethics: What you create with AI reflects on you

**Remember:** AI is a powerful tool. Like a calculator helps with math but doesn't make you a mathematician, AI helps with thinking but shouldn't replace YOUR brain!`,
    example: `**Scenario: You have a Hindi essay due tomorrow**

**Wrong approach:**
"ChatGPT, write my essay on 'Mera Priya Tyohaar' (My Favorite Festival)"
Then copy-paste the entire response.

**Right approach:**
1. "ChatGPT, what are some interesting angles I could explore when writing about Diwali?"
2. "What's a good essay structure for Class 9 Hindi?"
3. "I wrote this introduction: [your text]. How can I make it more engaging?"
4. Write the essay yourself using the ideas and feedback
5. At the end: "I brainstormed ideas using ChatGPT, but the essay is written by me"

**The difference:** 
- Wrong: You learn nothing, risk getting caught, violate trust
- Right: You improve your writing, understand the topic better, and maintain integrity`,

    explanation: `Ready for some behind-the-scenes AI knowledge? This module is optional but great for curious minds!

**Transformer Architecture:**
ChatGPT uses a "Transformer" - a type of neural network invented in 2017. The key innovation is "attention" - the ability to focus on relevant parts of input.

When you ask "What did the cat do?" after saying "The cat sat on the mat," the transformer's attention mechanism connects "cat" to "sat" across the sentence.

**Temperature & Sampling:**
"Temperature" controls how creative vs predictable the AI is:
• Low (0.1-0.3): Very consistent, predictable responses
• Medium (0.5-0.7): Balanced creativity and accuracy
• High (0.8-1.0): More creative, sometimes unexpected

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):**
ChatGPT was trained in stages:
1. Pre-training on massive text data
2. Fine-tuning with human demonstrations
3. RLHF: Humans ranked responses, AI learned preferences

**Tokenization Details:**
Different tokenizers break text differently:
• "Namaste" might be 2 tokens: "Nam" + "aste"
• Rare words get split into more tokens
• Code and special characters use more tokens

**Model Sizes:**
• GPT-3: ~175 billion parameters
• GPT-4: Estimated 100+ billion parameters (exact number not public)
• More parameters generally = more capable but slower`,
    example: `**Understanding Attention with an example:**

Sentence: "The trophy didn't fit in the suitcase because it was too big."

What does "it" refer to? The trophy or the suitcase?

**Human brain:** Instantly connects "it" to "trophy" (because "too big" makes sense for trophy not fitting)

**Transformer attention:** 
1. Calculates "attention scores" between "it" and every other word
2. Highest attention between "it" and "trophy"
3. Uses this to understand "it" refers to the trophy

This "attention" mechanism is why transformers are so good at understanding context!

**Temperature in action:**
Prompt: "Write a creative opening line for a story"

Temperature 0.2: "The sun rose over the mountains as Sarah began her journey."
Temperature 0.9: "The clouds tasted like forgotten birthday cake that Tuesday when I discovered I could fly."

Low temperature = safe and predictable
High temperature = creative but sometimes weird!`,

**Best Uses for Writing:**
• Brainstorming essay topics and angles
• Creating outlines and structures
• Getting feedback on your drafts
• Understanding different writing styles
• Learning grammar and vocabulary

**Claude's Writing Workflow:**

1. **Explore the topic:** "What are interesting angles for writing about renewable energy in India?"

2. **Get structure:** "Create an outline for a 500-word persuasive essay on this topic"

3. **Write yourself** (this is the important part!)

4. **Get feedback:** "Review my essay and suggest 3 specific improvements"

5. **Polish:** "Is this sentence grammatically correct: [your sentence]?"

**Claude as Writing Coach:**
Ask Claude to act as a writing coach rather than a writer:
"Be my writing coach. Don't write for me, but guide me through improving my essay. Ask me questions and give feedback."`,
    example: `**Student writing a letter for Model UN application:**

**Step 1 - Brainstorm:**
"I'm applying for Model UN at my school. What should I include in my application letter?"

**Claude:** "Great initiative! For a Model UN application, consider including:
- Your interest in international affairs
- Any relevant experience (debates, public speaking)
- Countries/issues you'd like to represent
- What skills you want to develop..."

**Step 2 - Get structure:**
"Help me organize this into a professional letter format"

**Step 3 - Write it yourself**

**Step 4 - Get feedback:**
"Here's my draft. What could make it stronger?"

**Claude:** "Your draft is a good start! I notice:
1. The opening is a bit generic - could you start with something more memorable?
2. You mention teamwork but don't give an example
3. The closing could be more confident..."

**Result:** YOUR letter, but refined with helpful guidance!`,

    explanation: `Claude is excellent at breaking down complex information. Here's how to use it for research and analysis:

**Strong Analysis Uses:**
• Summarizing long articles or chapters
• Explaining complex concepts simply
• Comparing different viewpoints
• Finding patterns in information
• Breaking down arguments logically

**Effective Analysis Prompts:**

1. **Summarize:** "Summarize this chapter in 5 bullet points"

2. **Explain:** "Explain the causes of inflation like I'm in Class 9"

3. **Compare:** "Compare parliamentary and presidential systems - give me a table format"

4. **Analyze:** "What are the main arguments in this paragraph? Are they strong or weak?"

5. **Question:** "What questions should I ask to understand this topic better?"

**Claude's Analysis Strengths:**
• Good at seeing multiple sides of issues
• Carefully separates facts from opinions
• Acknowledges complexity rather than oversimplifying
• Helps you think critically about sources`,
    example: `**Student researching for a project on Indian economy:**

**Request:** "I found this news article about India's GDP growth. Can you help me analyze it?"

**Claude's analysis:**
"I'd be happy to help you analyze this! Let me break it down:

**Main claims:**
1. GDP grew by X% this quarter
2. Manufacturing was the main driver
3. Experts predict continued growth

**Questions to consider:**
- What time period is this comparing to?
- Which sectors weren't mentioned?
- Who are the 'experts' cited?

**What's strong:**
- Uses official government data
- Provides specific numbers

**What to verify:**
- Check if other sources report similar figures
- Look for opposing viewpoints

Would you like me to help you understand any of these points further?"`,

    minutes: 10,
    level: 'intermediate',
    explanation: `Anthropic built Claude with strong safety features. Understanding these helps you use it better:

**Constitutional AI:**
Claude was trained using "Constitutional AI" - a set of principles it tries to follow:
• Be helpful but avoid harm
• Be honest about limitations
• Refuse harmful requests politely
• Consider multiple perspectives
• Protect user privacy

**What Claude Won't Do:**
• Help create harmful content
• Pretend to be human when directly asked
• Give dangerous instructions
• Encourage illegal activities
• Share others' private information

**How Claude Handles Difficult Topics:**
Instead of refusing bluntly, Claude often:
• Explains why it can't help with something
• Offers alternative approaches
• Provides educational context
• Suggests speaking to trusted adults or experts

**Why Safety Matters:**
These features protect you and others. An AI without safety measures could be misused. Claude's careful approach means it's a trustworthy learning companion.`,
    example: `**How Claude handles sensitive requests:**

**User:** "How can I cheat on my exam?"

**Claude's approach:**
"I understand exams can be stressful, but I can't help with cheating - it wouldn't be fair to classmates who studied, and you'd miss the learning.

Instead, I can help you:
- Create a study schedule for the time you have
- Explain difficult concepts
- Make practice questions
- Share memory techniques

Would any of these help? What subject is the exam in?"

**Notice:** Claude:
✓ Doesn't lecture or shame
✓ Explains the reasoning
✓ Offers helpful alternatives
✓ Stays supportive`,

**What Gemini Can Do With Images:**
• Describe what's in a photo
• Read and explain diagrams
• Analyze charts and graphs
• Extract text from images (OCR)
• Identify objects, places, animals
• Answer questions about visual content

**Great Uses for Students:**

1. **Diagram Explanations:**
   Upload a science diagram and ask "Explain this diagram step by step"

2. **Math Problem Photos:**
   Take a photo of a textbook problem and ask for help solving it

3. **Chart Analysis:**
   Share a graph and ask "What does this data show? What trends do you notice?"

4. **Note Organization:**
   Take photos of handwritten notes and ask Gemini to organize them

5. **Visual Learning:**
   "Looking at this image of a cell, quiz me on the parts"`,
    example: `**Student using Gemini for biology homework:**

**Step 1:** Takes photo of a complex cell diagram from textbook

**Step 2:** Uploads to Gemini with prompt:
"Here's a diagram of an animal cell. Can you:
1. Label all the parts you can identify
2. Explain what each part does
3. Point out what makes this an animal cell vs plant cell"

**Gemini's response:**
"I can see this is an animal cell diagram. Let me identify the parts:

**Nucleus** (the large circular structure in center) - Contains DNA, controls cell activities
**Mitochondria** (the oval shapes) - Produces energy for the cell
**Cell membrane** (the outer boundary) - Controls what enters and leaves
...

This is an animal cell because:
- No cell wall (plant cells have one)
- No chloroplasts (plant cells have these for photosynthesis)
- Smaller vacuoles (plant cells have one large one)

    explanation: `Gemini is excellent at understanding and helping with code! Even if you're just starting to learn programming:

**What Gemini Can Help With:**
• Explain code line by line
• Find and fix errors (debugging)
• Write simple programs
• Translate between programming languages
• Suggest improvements
• Answer coding questions

**Beginner-Friendly Uses:**

1. **Understanding existing code:**
   "Explain this Python code step by step: [paste code]"

2. **Learning concepts:**
   "What is a variable in programming? Give me a simple example in Python"

3. **Debugging help:**
   "My code gives an error: [paste error]. What's wrong?"

4. **Building simple projects:**
   "How would I make a simple calculator program in Python?"

**Why This Matters:**
Coding is becoming essential in many fields. Using AI to learn programming is like having a patient tutor who can explain things multiple ways until you understand!`,
    example: `**Student learning Python:**

**Student:** "I wrote this code but it's not working:

print("What's your name?")
name = input
print("Hello" + name)

Can you help?"

**Gemini:**
"I can see a couple of issues! Let me explain:

**Line 2 Problem:**
You wrote \`name = input\` but you need \`name = input()\`

The parentheses () are important because:
- \`input\` = the function itself
- \`input()\` = calling the function to get user's input

**Line 3 Problem:**
\`"Hello" + name\` will work, but add a space: \`"Hello " + name\` or better: \`"Hello, " + name + "!"\`

**Fixed code:**
print("What's your name?")
name = input()
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

**Try it now!** Would you like me to explain how input() works in more detail?"`,

    explanation: `Google has built safety features into Gemini. Here's how to use it responsibly:

**What Gemini Won't Do:**
• Generate harmful or illegal content
• Create misleading information intentionally
• Make realistic fake images of real people
• Help with academic dishonesty
• Share private information

**Best Practices:**

1. **Verify important information:**
   Gemini integrates with Search, but still verify facts

2. **Use for learning, not cheating:**
   Let Gemini help you understand, not do your work

3. **Understand AI limitations:**
   Even with images, Gemini can make mistakes

4. **Respect privacy:**
   Don't upload others' private photos or information

5. **Credit appropriately:**
   If AI significantly helped, acknowledge it

**Remember:**
Google's AI principles include being socially beneficial and avoiding unfair bias. Gemini is designed to be helpful while maintaining these standards.`,
    example: `**Responsible vs irresponsible use:**

**Irresponsible:** 
"Gemini, write my entire history essay for me"
Problem: That's academic dishonesty

**Responsible:**
"Help me understand the causes of World War I so I can write my essay"
Why it's better: You learn, you write, AI helps you understand

**Irresponsible:**
Uploading classmate's private photos to "analyze"
Problem: Privacy violation

**Responsible:**
Uploading your own diagrams or public images for learning
Why it's better: Respects privacy, focuses on education

**Irresponsible:**
Trusting every AI-generated fact without checking
Problem: AI can be wrong

**Responsible:**
Using Gemini's connected Search to verify, and checking other sources too
Why it's better: You're thinking critically`,

**1. Color:**
• Use 2-3 main colors (not more!)
• Pick colors that work together
• Canva suggests color palettes
• Consider readability (dark text on light, or light on dark)

**2. Typography:**
• Maximum 2-3 fonts per design
• One for headings, one for body text
• Make sure text is readable
• Don't use "fun" fonts for serious content

**3. Alignment:**
• Keep elements aligned (not scattered)
• Use Canva's guides and grids
• Consistent spacing looks professional

**4. White Space:**
• Don't fill every empty spot
• Breathing room makes designs cleaner
• Less is often more

**5. Hierarchy:**
• Most important info = biggest/boldest
• Guide the viewer's eye
• What should they see first?

**6. Images:**
• Use high-quality images
• Keep consistent style
• Don't stretch or distort
• Ensure appropriate attribution`,
    example: `**Good vs Bad Design Comparison:**

**Bad Poster:**
- 6 different fonts
- 10 bright colors that clash
- Text placed randomly
- Every inch filled with content
- Tiny, unreadable text

**Good Poster:**
- 2 fonts (one bold heading, one clean body)
- 3 colors that complement each other
- Clear alignment with margins
- White space around elements
- Large title, medium subheading, smaller details

**The Squint Test:**
Squint at your design. Can you still tell what's important?
- If yes = good hierarchy
- If everything blurs together = needs improvement

**The 5-Second Test:**
Show someone your design for 5 seconds. Can they tell:
- What it's about?
- What's most important?
If yes, your design communicates well!`,

**Credit & Copyright:**
• Don't use copyrighted images without permission
• Canva's library is licensed for use
• Credit creators when required
• Stock photos ≠ free to use anywhere

**AI-Generated Images:**
• Label AI images when it matters
• Don't create fake photos of real people
• Consider impact before sharing
• Check for unintended biases

**Accurate Information:**
• Don't create misleading graphics
• Verify statistics before designing infographics
• "Professional-looking" doesn't mean "true"
• Consider how your design might be misunderstood

**Privacy:**
• Get permission before using others' photos
• Don't create content that could embarrass others
• Think twice before sharing personal content

**Representation:**
• Include diverse representations
• Avoid stereotypes in your designs
• Be thoughtful about cultural imagery`,
    example: `**Scenario: Creating an infographic for a school project**

**Wrong approach:**
1. Find a statistic online without checking the source
2. Make it look impressive with big numbers
3. Use Canva to make it professional-looking
4. Don't cite any sources

**Why it's wrong:** Professional design can spread misinformation. A fake stat in a nice infographic might be shared and believed.

**Right approach:**
1. Find statistics from reliable sources (government data, research papers)
2. Note the source, date, and context
3. Design the infographic with accurate data
4. Include source citations on the design
5. If using AI-generated images, note that they're illustrations

    minutes: 10,
    level: 'beginner',
    explanation: `Syllaby is an AI tool that helps plan and organize content. While it's designed for content creators, the skills you'll learn are valuable for any project!

**What is Content Planning?**
Content planning means organizing what you'll create before you create it:
• Topics you'll cover
• Order of content
• Key points for each piece
• Schedule for creation

**Why Learn Content Planning?**

Even if you're not a YouTuber, these skills help with:
• School presentations
• Project organization
• Speech preparation
• Blog posts or stories
• Club activities

**What Syllaby Can Do:**
• Generate content ideas based on topics
• Create outlines for videos/posts
• Suggest trending topics
• Help plan content calendars

**The bigger lesson:**
AI tools like Syllaby teach you how to plan before creating - a skill that applies to everything from essays to science projects!`,
    example: `**How content planning applies to school:**

**Without planning:**
"I need to make a presentation on climate change"
→ Starts PowerPoint immediately
→ Gets stuck halfway
→ Realizes they missed important topics
→ Rushes at the end

**With planning (Syllaby mindset):**
"I need to make a presentation on climate change"

Step 1: Brainstorm topics
- What is climate change?
- Causes (natural vs human)
- Effects (local and global)
- Solutions
- What teens can do

Step 2: Organize flow
- Start with attention-grabbing fact
- Build understanding progressively
- End with call to action

Step 3: Estimate time
- Introduction: 1 minute
- Main content: 5 minutes
- Conclusion: 1 minute

Step 4: Now create with a clear map!

**The result:** Better, faster, more organized work`,

    title: 'AI-Powered Idea Generation',
    minutes: 12,
    level: 'beginner',
    explanation: `One of the hardest parts of creating content is coming up with ideas. AI tools can help!

**How AI Helps Generate Ideas:**
• Suggests topics you might not think of
• Explores different angles on a subject
• Identifies what audiences care about
• Breaks creative blocks

**Idea Generation Prompts:**
You can use any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) with these prompts:

1. **Topic expansion:**
   "Give me 10 different angles for a presentation about [topic]"

2. **Question-based:**
   "What questions do teenagers have about [topic]?"

3. **Connection finding:**
   "How does [topic] connect to [other interest]?"

4. **Format ideas:**
   "What are creative ways to present information about [topic]?"

5. **Audience-specific:**
   "What would Class 10 students find interesting about [topic]?"

**Remember:**
• AI gives starting points - you add your perspective
• Not all AI suggestions are good - use judgment
• The best ideas often combine AI suggestions with your own`,
    example: `**Brainstorming for a YouTube channel about study tips:**

**Student's prompt:**
"I want to make videos helping Indian students study better. Give me 10 video topic ideas that would be useful for Class 10-12 students."

**AI suggestions:**
1. "How to make a study timetable that actually works"
2. "Best apps for students in India (free options!)"
3. "How to study for boards: Science vs. Arts"
4. "Memory techniques using Hindi/regional mnemonics"
5. "How to stay focused during exam season"
6. "Study room setup on a budget"
7. "How toppers actually study (myth vs reality)"
8. "Dealing with exam anxiety: What works"
9. "How to balance school, coaching, and personal time"
10. "Note-taking methods compared"

**Student's process:**
1. Read all suggestions
2. Star favorites (3, 4, 7 seem most interesting)
3. Add own ideas: "How I went from 60% to 90%" (personal story)
4. Combine: "Memory techniques + regional examples = unique angle!"

**Result:** A list of ideas that blend AI suggestions with personal perspective`,

    title: 'Creating Outlines & Scripts',
    minutes: 15,
    level: 'intermediate',
    explanation: `Once you have ideas, the next step is organizing them into outlines or scripts:

**The Power of Outlines:**
An outline is your content's skeleton. It helps you:
• Organize thoughts logically
• Ensure you cover everything
• Estimate time/length
• Stay focused while creating

**Script Structure (for videos, presentations, speeches):**

1. **Hook (10%):** Grab attention immediately
   "What if I told you that you've been studying wrong your whole life?"

2. **Introduction (10%):** Set expectations
   "In this video, I'll share 3 techniques that helped me top my class"

3. **Main Content (70%):** The core information
   - Point 1 with example
   - Point 2 with example
   - Point 3 with example

4. **Conclusion (10%):** Wrap up with action
   "Try technique #1 today and let me know if it works!"

**AI for Scripting:**
"Create an outline for a 5-minute video about [topic] for [audience]"
"Help me write a script for [topic] - I want to cover [points]"`,
    example: `**Creating a script for a school assembly speech:**

**Topic:** "Why Reading Matters"
**Time:** 3 minutes

**Outline created with AI help:**

**Hook (15 sec):**
"Raise your hand if you'd rather watch a movie than read a book..." 
[Most hands go up]
"What if I told you that readers actually enjoy movies MORE?"

**Introduction (20 sec):**
"I'm [name], and today I want to share why reading changed how I see everything - including movies, games, and yes, even studying."

**Point 1 (45 sec): Reading = Better Imagination**
- Example: Reading Harry Potter vs. watching it
- Your imagination creates YOUR perfect Hogwarts
- Quiz scores improve when you can visualize

**Point 2 (45 sec): Reading = Better Focus**
- Our phones train us for 30-second attention
- Reading trains deep focus
- My own experience with longer study sessions

**Point 3 (45 sec): Reading = Better Vocabulary**
- Story about learning words from books
- How it helped in essays and conversations
- "Wasn't trying to learn - just happened!"

**Conclusion (30 sec):**
"You don't have to give up screens. Just add 20 minutes of reading. Try it for one week. I bet you'll notice a difference. Thank you!"

    minutes: 12,
    level: 'intermediate',
    explanation: `When creating content - whether for social media, school, or hobbies - authenticity matters:

**What is Authenticity?**
Being authentic means:
• Your voice and perspective shine through
• AI assists but doesn't replace you
• Your experiences and opinions are real
• You don't pretend to be someone you're not

**Why Authenticity Matters:**
• Audiences can sense fake content
• Authentic creators build trust
• Your unique perspective is valuable
• Copying doesn't develop your skills

**Ethical Content Creation:**

1. **Give Credit:**
   - If AI helped significantly, acknowledge it
   - Credit others' ideas you build on
   - Don't claim AI work as entirely yours

2. **Be Truthful:**
   - Don't fake experiences for content
   - Be honest about what you know and don't know
   - Verify facts before sharing

3. **Consider Impact:**
   - Will your content help or harm?
   - Think about how different people might react
   - Would you be proud of this tomorrow?

4. **Respect Others:**
   - Don't use content to mock or hurt
   - Respect privacy
   - Think before posting about others`,
    example: `**Authentic vs. Inauthentic Content:**

**Inauthentic approach:**
"Here's how I scored 99% in boards" 
(When you actually scored 75%)
Uses AI to write everything
Never studied what they're teaching
Just wants views

**Why it fails:**
- Deceptive to viewers
- Advice may not work
- Builds fake persona
- Gets exposed eventually

**Authentic approach:**
"How I improved from 60% to 80%"
(Real story with real struggles)
Uses AI to organize ideas
Shares genuine techniques that worked
Wants to help others

**Why it works:**
- Relatable and honest
- Viewers trust you
- Advice is tested
- Builds real connection

**The Authenticity Test:**
Ask yourself:
- Is this really my story/experience?
- Would I say this if my teacher/supervisor watched?
- Am I helping or just seeking attention?
- Would I respect someone who created this?`,
