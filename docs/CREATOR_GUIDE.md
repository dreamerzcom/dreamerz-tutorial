---

## 2. Getting to the Creator Dashboard

1. Log in with a `creator` account.
2. Click **Admin** in the top navigation bar, or open the user menu and select **Content Management**.
3. You land at `/admin`. The **Course Manager** tab is pre-selected.

---

## 3. Course Management

### 3.1 Creating a Course

Two modes are available from the Course Manager:

| Mode | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Manual** | You already have content and want full structural control |
| **AI-Assisted** | You have a source document (PDF / DOCX / TXT) or want Claude to generate content from a brief |

A new course is always created in **Draft** status and is invisible to learners until you publish it.

### 3.2 Editing Course Metadata

From the course list, click the pencil icon or click into a course to open the editor. You can set:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Course title shown in the catalogue |
| **Tagline** | Short description (up to 500 chars) shown on the course card |
| **Description** | Full course description |
| **Category** | Assigned category (e.g. AI Learning, Conversational English) |
| **Difficulty** | `beginner` / `intermediate` / `advanced` |
| **Icon** | URL or uploaded image used as the course icon |
| **Theme colour** | Hex colour used for card accents |
| **Total XP** | XP awarded to learners on course completion |
| **Sort order** | Controls display order in the catalogue |
| **Available languages** | List of language codes the course supports |

### 3.3 Draft vs. Published Courses

- **Draft** — only visible to the creating user and admins. Learners cannot see it.
- **Published** — visible in the learner catalogue at `/learn`.

To edit a published course without affecting live learners, use **Create Draft** — this creates an editable copy. When the draft is ready, re-publish it to overwrite the live version.

### 3.4 Deleting a Course

Deletes the course and all its modules, lessons, quizzes, and media associations. This action is permanent and only available to the course owner or an admin.

---

## 4. Module (Section) Management

Courses are structured as: **Course → Modules → Lessons**

### Creating a Module

Inside the course editor, click **Add Section**. Each module has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Module name shown to learners |
| **Description** | Optional module description |
| **Sort order** | Controls order within the course |
| **Status** | `draft` or `published` |
| **Is active** | Toggle to hide without deleting |

### Reordering Modules

Drag a module by its ⋮⋮ handle in the Builder tab to reorder it (see
[§16](#16-reordering-with-drag--drop)). The `sort_order` field is updated
automatically; lower numbers appear first.

### Deleting a Module

Deleting a module cascades and removes all lessons inside it.

---

## 5. Lesson Management

### Creating a Lesson

Inside a module, click **Add Lesson**. Lesson metadata fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Lesson name |
| **Description** | Short lesson description |
| **Level** | `beginner` / `intermediate` / `advanced` |
| **Estimated minutes** | Displayed duration estimate |
| **XP reward** | XP granted to learners on completion |
| **Week / Day** | Optional scheduling grouping fields |
| **Is weekly test** | Mark lesson as an assessment lesson |
| **Sort order** | Order within the module |
| **Status** | `draft` or `published` |

### Editing Lesson Content

Each lesson can have rich structured content:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Explanation** | Main lesson body (supports Markdown) |
| **Example** | Worked example text |
| **Activity** | Practice task for the learner |
| **Bengali tip** | Language-specific tip (optional) |
| **Micro grammar** | Grammar note (optional) |
| **Speaking task** | Conversation / speaking prompt |
| **Vocabulary** | JSON dictionary of terms and definitions |
| **Dialogue** | JSON-structured conversation exercise |
| **Language** | Language code this content belongs to (e.g. `en`, `bn`) |

Lessons support **multi-language content**: you can create separate content records for each language under the same lesson. The learner's preferred language is used to select the right content at runtime.

---

## 6. Quiz Builder

Each lesson can have one quiz attached. Open the **Quiz** tab inside a lesson to build it.

### Quiz Settings

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Title** | Quiz title |
| **Passing score** | Minimum percentage to pass (0–100) |
| **Max attempts** | How many times a learner can retake |
| **Shuffle questions** | Randomise question order for each attempt |
| **Shuffle options** | Randomise answer choices for each question |

### Question Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `mcq` | Multiple choice — one correct answer |
| `multi-select` | Multiple correct answers can be selected |
| `true-false` | True or False question |
| `short-answer` | Open text response |

### Question Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Question text** | The question prompt |
| **Options** | Array of answer choices |
| **Correct answer** | Index, boolean, or string depending on type |
| **Hint** | Explanatory hint shown on incorrect answer |
| **Feedback** | JSON feedback (can include image references) |
| **Sort order** | Question sequence |

---

## 7. Media Management

Media assets (images, videos, documents, audio) can be attached to lessons or used as quiz question images.

### Uploading Media

Three upload methods are available:

| Method | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Direct upload** (`POST /media/upload`) | Upload files directly from your device |
| **Signed URL upload** (`POST /media/sign-upload`) | Large files — get a Cloudinary signed URL and upload directly to CDN |
| **YouTube link** (`POST /media/youtube`) | Create a video asset from a YouTube URL |

### Supported Asset Types

- `image` — PNG, JPG, WebP, GIF
- `video` — MP4, MOV (processed to adaptive streaming)
- `document` — PDF, DOCX
- `audio` — MP3, WAV

### Media Asset Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Alt text** | Accessibility description for images |
| **Duration** | Auto-detected for video/audio |
| **Poster URL** | Thumbnail image for videos |
| **Sort order** | Order when multiple assets are attached to a lesson |
| **Is highlight** | Marks asset as the hero/featured media |
| **Tags** | e.g. `["quiz-question"]` |

### Attaching Media to Lessons

After uploading, use **Attach** to link an existing asset to a specific lesson. One asset can be attached to multiple lessons.

### Deleting Media

Deletes the asset from Cloudinary and removes all attachment records.

---

## 8. AI-Assisted Course Creation

> **Requires:** `ai_generation_enabled = true` on your account (set by admin).

The AI workflow uses Claude to generate full course content from a source document or topic brief.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### Step 1 — Parse a Source Document (optional)

Upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file. The system extracts plain text you can use as the AI's input material.

#### Step 2 — Generate a Blueprint

Provide:
- Source text (from step 1 or written manually)
- Desired number of modules
- Desired number of lessons per module
- Writing tone (e.g. friendly, formal, conversational)
- Optional hints or focus areas

Claude generates a full course **blueprint**: a structured JSON outline of modules, lessons, and quiz questions. A draft course record is created in the database at this point.

#### Step 3 — Review and Edit the Blueprint

Before generating content, you can manually edit the blueprint — rename modules, reorder lessons, change quiz questions — without committing to full content generation.

#### Step 4 — Generate Lesson Content

Two options:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Generate one lesson** | Generate explanation, example, and activity for a single lesson. Optionally enable a "critique" pass where the AI reviews and improves its own output. Custom instructions can be applied per lesson. |
| **Bulk generate all** | Generate all remaining ungenerated lessons in parallel. Optional critique pass applies to every lesson. |

#### Step 5 — Publish the Draft

Once satisfied, **Publish Draft** materialises the blueprint into the full module/lesson/quiz/content database structure and makes the course available for further editing and eventual publication.

### Managing Draft Courses

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| List drafts | View all your in-progress AI drafts |
| View draft | Inspect blueprint and generation status |
| Edit blueprint | Modify structure before generating content |
| Delete draft | Permanently discard a draft (does not affect published courses) |

---

## 9. Content Localisation & Translation

Courses can support multiple languages. For each lesson you can maintain separate `LessonContent` records per language code.

### Translating a Course

Trigger a full course translation via `POST /courses/{course_id}/translate`. Provide the target language code. The system translates all lesson content (explanation, example, activity, vocabulary, dialogue).

### Checking Translation Status

`GET /courses/{course_id}/translation-status` returns which lessons have content for each language and which are still pending.

### Manual Language Content

Use `PUT /lessons/{lesson_id}/content/{language}` to manually create or update lesson content for a specific language code without using AI translation.

---

## 10. Category Management

Categories group courses in the learner catalogue (e.g. "AI Learning", "Conversational English").

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| Create category | Add a new category with a name and slug |
| List categories | View all existing categories |
| Delete category | Remove a category (only possible if no courses are assigned to it) |

**Note:** Category display metadata (icon, gradient, description shown in the learner catalogue) is currently defined in frontend code (`CATEGORY_META` in `LearnHub.jsx`). The category slug in the database must match the key in that object for full metadata to appear.

---

## 11. Learner Preview

Before publishing, click **Preview as Learner** on any course. This calls `GET /courses/{course_id}/learner-preview` and renders the course exactly as a learner would see it, including module structure, lesson content, and quizzes — without changing the draft status.

---

## 12. Publishing Workflow

```
Create Course (draft)
        │
        ▼
  Build Modules & Lessons
        │
        ▼
  Add Quizzes & Media
        │
        ▼
  Preview as Learner
        │
        ▼
  Publish → Visible at /learn
        │
        ▼
  (Need to edit a live course?)
        │
        ▼
  Create Draft Version → edit safely → Re-publish
```

**Key rules:**
- Draft courses are invisible to learners.
- Published courses appear immediately in the `/learn` catalogue.
- Creating a draft of a published course lets you edit without disrupting live learners.
- Re-publishing a draft overwrites the live version.

---

## 13. Ownership & Access Control

- **Creators can only modify courses they created.** The `created_by` field (set automatically on creation) is checked on every update and delete.
- **Admins bypass ownership checks** and can modify any course.
- **Draft courses** are only visible to their owner or admins — other creators cannot see your drafts.
- **AI generation drafts** are scoped the same way: only the creating user or an admin can read, edit, or delete them. Ownership violations return a `404` (not `403`) to avoid leaking draft existence.

---

## 14. Course Analytics

Every course now has an **Analytics** tab in the course editor (top of the
course detail view). It is read-only and reflects live learner activity drawn
from enrolment and assessment records — nothing you do here changes content.

| Section | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **KPI cards** | Total enrolments, completion rate, average progress, total learning time, weekly active learners, average quiz score |
| **Lesson completion (drop-off)** | Per-lesson completion rate — quickly spot where learners stall |
| **Enrolments (last 30 days)** | Daily new-enrolment trend line |
| **Quiz performance** | Total attempts, pass rate, count awaiting manual grading, and the **hardest questions** (lowest correct-answer rate, min. 3 answers) |

Endpoint: `GET /admin/courses/{course_id}/analytics`. Visible to the course
owner and admins.

---

## 15. Cloning a Course

The **Clone** button (course header) deep-copies an entire course — modules,
lessons, every language's content, quizzes/questions, and media attachments —
into a **brand-new independent draft** owned by you.

- Differs from **Create Draft**: a clone is *not* linked to a published parent
  and re-publishing it never overwrites another course. Use it to spin up a new
  course from an existing template, or to experiment safely.
- The new course is named `"<original> (Copy)"` and starts in **Draft** status.
- Media assets reference the same Cloudinary files (no re-upload).

Endpoint: `POST /admin/courses/{course_id}/clone`.

---

## 16. Reordering with Drag & Drop

In the **Builder** tab, modules and lessons can be reordered by dragging
(grab the ⋮⋮ handle). On a draft course you can:

- Drag a **module** up or down to change its position.
- Drag a **lesson** within its module, or onto another module to **move it**.

Order is saved automatically. (Published courses are read-only — create a draft
version first.) The manual `sort_order` fields still exist and stay in sync.

Endpoints: `PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/sections/reorder`,
`PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/lessons/reorder`.

---

## 17. Manual Grading Queue

Short-answer quiz responses can't be auto-graded. The **Grading** tab lists
every attempt with a short-answer response awaiting a human grade:

1. Read the learner's answer next to the question prompt.
2. Enter a **score** (out of the question's max) and optional per-answer feedback.
3. Add an optional overall feedback note and click **Submit grade**.

Submitting recomputes the attempt's total/percentage, marks it
**teacher-graded**, and sets pass/fail from the quiz's passing score. The graded
attempt then drops off the queue. The Analytics tab's *awaiting grading* count
reflects this queue.

Endpoints: `GET /admin/courses/{course_id}/grading-queue`,
`POST /admin/attempts/{attempt_id}/grade`.

---

## 18. Completion Certificates

Open the **Certificate** tab to enable automatic completion certificates:

- Toggle **Issue a certificate automatically when a learner completes this course**.
- Optionally set a **certificate title** (defaults to “Certificate of Completion — <course>”).

When an enrolled learner finishes every published lesson, a certificate is
issued automatically with a unique **serial**. The tab lists all issued
certificates and lets you **revoke / restore** any of them. Certificates
snapshot the learner name and course name at issue time, so they remain valid
even if the course is later edited.

| Surface | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Configure | `PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/certificate` |
| List issued | `GET /admin/courses/{course_id}/certificates` |
| Revoke / restore | `POST /admin/certificates/{serial}/revoke` |
| Learner's own certificates | `GET /certificates/me` |
| Public verification | `GET /certificates/verify/{serial}` (no auth) |

---

## 19. Announcements

The **Announcements** tab lets you post notices to learners enrolled in a
course. Each announcement has a title and body, and can be:

- **Pinned** to the top of the feed.
- Saved as a **draft** (unpublished) or published immediately; drafts are only
  visible to you and admins.

Published announcements appear in the learner's course feed (pinned first, then
newest first). Edit, pin/unpin, publish/unpublish, or delete at any time.

| Surface | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| List (incl. drafts) | `GET /admin/courses/{course_id}/announcements` |
| Create | `POST /admin/courses/{course_id}/announcements` |
| Edit | `PUT /admin/announcements/{announcement_id}` |
| Delete | `DELETE /admin/announcements/{announcement_id}` |
| Learner feed (published only) | `GET /courses/{course_id}/announcements` |

---

## 20. Creator Dashboard (Aggregate)

When you open **Content Management** you now land on the **Creator Dashboard** —
an aggregate view across *all* your courses (admins see every course). Use the
**Dashboard / Courses** toggle at the top to switch to the course list.

It shows KPI cards (total learners, active learners in 30 days, completions,
revenue, average progress, certificates issued, items awaiting grading, course
count) and a per-course table (status, price, learners, completion rate,
revenue) with an **Open** action for each course.

Endpoint: `GET /admin/creator/dashboard`.

---

## 21. Pricing, Coupons & Sales Pages

The **Pricing & Sales** tab inside a course covers monetization:

### Pricing
- Mark a course **free**, or set a **list price** + **currency** (USD, INR, EUR, …).

### Coupons
- Create per-course discount codes: **percent** or **fixed** amount, optional
  **max redemptions** and **expiry date**. Redemption counts are tracked.
- Coupons apply only to paid courses.

### Sales page
- Edit a learner-facing landing page: **headline**, **subheadline**, **learning
  outcomes** (one per line), **instructor bio**, **CTA label**, **FAQs**, and
  **testimonials**. Saved as structured content the public sales page renders.

| Surface | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Set pricing | `PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/pricing` |
| Save sales page | `PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/sales-page` |
| List / create coupons | `GET` / `POST /admin/courses/{course_id}/coupons` |
| Delete coupon | `DELETE /admin/coupons/{coupon_id}` |
| Public sales page | `GET /courses/{course_id}/sales-page` (no auth) |

---

## 22. Checkout & Enrollment

DreamerZ ships a **gateway-agnostic checkout**. Today it runs on a **mock
provider** so the full flow is testable; swapping in Stripe or Razorpay later
only means creating the provider order in `create_checkout` and confirming from
the provider's webhook.

- **Free courses** (or coupons that bring the total to 0) enrol the learner
  immediately.
- **Paid courses** create a `pending` order; confirming it (the mock gateway
  success) marks it `paid` and enrols the learner. Orders are recorded for the
  dashboard revenue figure.

| Surface | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Validate coupon (price quote) | `POST /courses/{course_id}/coupon/validate` |
| Start checkout | `POST /courses/{course_id}/checkout` |
| Confirm (mock gateway) | `POST /orders/{order_id}/confirm` |

> **Wiring a real gateway:** provide the provider keys, create the provider
> order inside `create_checkout` (in `services/commerce_service.py`), and call
> `confirm_order` from the provider's verified webhook instead of the mock
> confirm endpoint.

---

## 23. Delivery: Drip & Free Preview

The **Delivery** tab controls *when* lessons unlock and *which* lessons
unenrolled learners can sample.

### Drip rules (course-level)
Enable drip and pick a rule:

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `none` | All lessons unlocked |
| `sequential` | A lesson unlocks once the previous one is completed |
| `days_after_enrollment` | Each lesson unlocks N days after the learner enrols (set per lesson) |
| `date` | Each lesson unlocks on a fixed calendar date (set per lesson) |

### Free preview (per lesson)
Mark any lesson **Free preview** to let unenrolled learners view it on the
sales page even when the course is paid.

The learner's unlock state is computed by `GET /courses/{course_id}/access`,
which returns, per lesson, whether it's `unlocked` and (if not) the reason
(`purchase_required`, `scheduled`, `complete_previous`).

| Surface | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Course drip config | `PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/delivery` |
| Per-lesson preview / drip | `PUT /admin/lessons/{lesson_id}/delivery` |
| Learner access map | `GET /courses/{course_id}/access` |

---

## 24. Completion Criteria

Also on the **Delivery** tab, choose what counts as completing the course:

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `all_lessons` (default) | Every published lesson completed |
| `all_lessons_and_quizzes` | Every lesson completed **and** every quiz passed |

Completion drives status, the dashboard completion rate, and certificate
issuance. Endpoint: `PUT /admin/courses/{course_id}/delivery`.

---

## 25. Learner Roster

The **Learners** tab is a creator-scoped roster of everyone enrolled in a
course: username/email, enrolment status, progress bar (lessons completed /
total), average quiz score, and last-active date — with client-side search.
Admins see rosters for any course; creators only their own.

Endpoint: `GET /admin/courses/{course_id}/learners`.

---
